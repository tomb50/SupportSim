SupportSim
==========

A Java mock-app that simulates a helpdesk environment (ticket generation, assignment, analyst management, work completion etc).

It uses:
Hibernate ORM for object persistence.
Spring for scheduling polling mechanisms.
An existing website template using Boostrap for the webpage layout/styling.
JSP (scriplets currently, but due to be re-worked) to dynamically pull data to the frontend.
